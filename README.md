# Customer-Segmentation-Using-Python-and-Power-BI
Objective: 
      Customer segmentation analysis using advanced data analytics techniques to identify valuable customer segments and develop targeted marketing strategies.
Description:
      I will work with a large dataset containing customer information, purchase history, and demographic data. I have used Python (Pandas) for data retrieval and preprocessing, handling missing values and outliers. Customer segmentation will involve advanced statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms (e.g., clustering) to identify distinct customer groups.After that I have created data visualizations in Power BI and Python to present the segmentation results and provide actionable insights. The project aims to improve marketing strategies, enhance customer engagement, and increase revenue through targeted campaigns.
